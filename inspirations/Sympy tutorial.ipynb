    "There are many computer algebra systems out there. [This Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_algebra_systems) lists many of them. What makes `SymPy` a better choice than the alternatives?\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, `SymPy` is completely free. It is open source, and licensed under the liberal BSD license, so you can even modify the source code and sell if you want to. This contrasts with popular commercial systems like Maple or Mathematica that cost hundreds of dollars in licenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, `SymPy` uses Python. Most computer algebra systems invent their own language. Not `SymPy`. `SymPy` is written entirely in Python, and is executed entirely in Python. This means that if you already know Python, it is much easier to get started with `SymPy`, because you already know the syntax (and if you don’t know Python, it is really easy to learn). Plus, we already know that Python is a well-designed, battle-tested language. The `SymPy` developers are confident in their abilities in writing mathematical software, but inventing a whole new programming language is a completely different thing. By reusing an existing language, we are able to focus on those things that matter, the mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another computer algebra system, Sage also uses Python as its language. But Sage is large, with a download of over a gigabyte. An advantage of `SymPy` is that it is lightweight. In addition to being relatively small, it has no dependencies other than Python, so it can be used almost anywhere easily. Furthermore, the goals of Sage and the goals of `SymPy` are different. Sage aims to be a full featured system for mathematics, and aims to do so by compiling all the major open source mathematical systems together into one. When you call some function in Sage, such as integrate, it calls out to one of the open source packages that it includes. In fact, `SymPy` is included in Sage. `SymPy` on the other hand aims to be an independent system, with all the features implemented in `SymPy` itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final important feature of `SymPy` is that it can be used as a library. Many computer algebra systems focus on being usable in interactive environments, but if you wish to automate or extend them, it is difficult to do. With `SymPy`, you can just as easily use it in an interactive Python environment or import it in your own Python application. `SymPy` also provides APIs to make it easy to extend it with your own custom functions."
