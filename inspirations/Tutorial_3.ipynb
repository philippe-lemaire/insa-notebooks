Typically numbers (or groups of numbers) or text (or lists of text). Different kinds of data can be used for different things: numbers can be combined in mathematical expressions, text can be printed, searched, or reorganised; numbers can be arranged by magnitude, names can be arranged by alphabetical order. In Python, these differences are represented by different **data types**.\n\n### Numbers: *int* and *float*<a id=\"numbers\"></a>\n\nWe will discuss two kinds of numeric types: integers and floating point numbers. Python has other built in numeric data types, including complex numbers, which are useful in specialised cases.\n\nWhole numbers, without decimal points are integers, e.g. <span style=\"color:#108714; font-family:monospace\">1</span>, <span style=\"color:#108714; font-family:monospace\">6</span>, <span style=\"color:#108714; font-family:monospace\">2331</span>.  \nNumbers with decimal points are floating point numbers or &ldquo;floats&rdquo;, e.g. <span style=\"color:#108714; font-family:monospace\">1.0</span>, <span style=\"color:#108714; font-family:monospace\">232.141</span>, <span style=\"color:#108714; font-family:monospace\">1.3e5</span>.  \nThat last example, <span style=\"color:#108714; font-family:monospace\">1.3e5</span>, uses scientific notation and is shorthand for <span style=\"color:#108714; font-family:monospace\">130000.0</span>."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Scientific Notation<a id=\"scientific_notation\"></a>\nVery large and very small numbers can be written using **scientific notation**. For example, instead of 0.0000241, we would normally write 2.41&times;10<sup>-5</sup>. In Python this would be written `2.41e-5` or `2.41e-05`.\n\n>```python\n2.41e-5 == 0.0000241\n```"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Strings<a id=\"strings\"></a>\n\nStrings are any sequence of text.
